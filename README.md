# About
This app saves contacts in its own database seperate from android contacts. This way no other app would be able to access contacts. Can be used in place of your default phone(dialer) app.

We can export / import contacts from Android contacts app into this app.
Maintains call log as well coz Android call log app would not be able to show name of contact
Also shows the person name upon recieving call
