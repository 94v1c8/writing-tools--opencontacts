    <string name="search_contacts_help_text">Tap on search icon in the menu. T9 Keyboard would pop out with only numbers but small letters three on each would be present and covers all the alphabets. Use the numeric keys to input name.\nExample: To search for contact \'john\', type 5646 because letter j is present on number 5, o is on 6 and so on. It might look a bit new but would be better than normal full keyboard search.\nYou could also search for phone number by entering the required number with the help of same keyboard.</string>

    <string name="callerid">Caller Id</string>
    <string name="callerid_help_text">Caller id refers to showing the name of contact during an incoming call.\n\nCaller id comes up and by default it sits almost at middle of the screen. But you can very well drag it to any place on screen you want and that position will be saved automatically.\n\n\nSo, after installing the app, try to get a call from any number and drag caller id to place it somewhere you like. But keep in my mind that caller id is draggable only when call comes when screen in unlocked. Android has this issue of not able to take input events on screens created while phone is locked. Hence make sure you unlock your screen before asking someone to call.</string>
